                  As suggested in our title, Nuclear Energy? Is it a green
                  source of energy ,rather, is it truly a way forward?

                  Well,that’s a question each one should ask themselves, the
                  ones who absolutely believe in the ideology of powering the
                  world with green sources of energy and gradually minimizing
                  the hazardous effects of fossil fuel energy that is accounted
                  for a large proportion of the climate change. Just like any
                  other source of energy ,nuclear energy also bears it own pros
                  and cons .There’s nothing in the world that comes without a
                  risk, it is only up to us, given the choice that we have ,to
                  make the right one and learn from our faults. Given the surge
                  in technology ,pioneering ideas in the field of energy and the
                  digital age upon us what better than to utilize the resources
                  to the fullest only for the better. The question to the world
                  out there is are we entirely harnessing the full potential of
                  the green energy sources? Then why are we still highly
                  dependent on fossil fuel energy? These are questions that we
                  leave you to ponder on.

                  As we dive right into nuclear energy, the first thought to
                  have struck everyone’s mind could probably be
                  oh!radiation,nuclear wastes! Not economical! , perhaps, even a
                  no way! However we may sometimes fail to understand why we are
                  filled with such reservations. Alongside development of
                  ingenious & sophisticated technologies, there must and should
                  a word of awareness with empirical proven facts & figures.
                  When we aren’t aware how will the world progress in unity? It
                  is far better to know the right facts and make a choice rather
                  than not knowing at all. Taking all this into account an
                  effort has been made to address certain myths that have been
                  tagged with nuclear energy for far too long.Being able to
                  enlighten even the smallest proportion of the total population
                  would mean being able to contribute to the world as we leave
                  it with a choice.

                    This addresses the fact that the utilization of fossil fuel
                    energy is still on the high and the current renewable energy
                    sources are not sufficient to account for a larger share of
                    electricity generation. Nuclear energy despite ,the very
                    many benefits that it offers ,are still not considered as
                    sufficient pros to replace fossil fuel energy. Another
                    aspect is that of costs and expertise required in this field
                    which is why a lot of reservations are held. We’re going to
                    be busting this myth by presenting facts based on parameters
                    such as CO2 emissions, particle release, waste disposal
                    recyclability, etc.

                    and soil into streams. Since the start of the Industrial

                    Here is the representation of the total number of fossil
                    fuels and uranium reserves that have been present so far and
                    to what extent it is being exploited/consumed .The lengths
                    on the batteries indicate the number of years for which it
                    can still be used.The metrics taken into consideration are
                    tonnes.However when we consider individual batteries it can
                    be observed that oil and coal reserves are being exploited
                    way more than the uranium reserves and that is particularly
                    indicated by the red bars:most exploitation & green

                    Most of the particles released from the fossil fuel plants
                    lead to short term health impacts whereas the radionuclides

                    utilized for the process of fission for energy production
                    and rest is considered as waste ,given the potential to
                    recycle ,efforts must be made to harness energy even from
                    the waste that is generated.Recycling will surely help

                    We can establish from the given data that coal, natural gas

                    Without any doubt, these renewable energy resources are more
                    environmental friendly as compared to fossil fuel energy
                    .This would totally account for 28% of the total electricity
                    that is generated from solar wind and hydroelectric energy.
                    However fossil fuels energy still account for the single
                    largest source of electricity i.e. around 63.3%.To be able
                    to fill in the gaps and reach at least half the electricity
                    production from green energy sources nuclear energy is a
                    source that can provide that support and will help
                    compliment the other sources of energy to reach that goal.

                    Below is a mind map as to understanding the solar,wind
                    ,hydro and nuclear based on the following parameters
                    i.e.,annual investments,social impact,capacity factor and
                    the percentage share of these energy sources.The entire
                    objective of considering this particular set of data is its
                    ability to correlate with the fact that nuclear energy could
                    have the potential to complement the other renewable energy
                    sources.The approximate figures that have been mentioned ,in
                    a way ,allows people to understand the current status and
                    thereby areas of improvement in the near future.

                There is a high potential for increase in annual investments in
                the field of nuclear energy given its high capacity factor,
                lesser restrictions In terms of land occupation, and less
                dependence on weather conditions;Unlike solar and wind that are
                highly dependent on sunlight and an efficient rate of
                wind,nuclear energy on the other hand can be harnessed without
                any specific weather dependency. It is essential that to prevent
                the drastic effects of climate change we must try and adopt all
                possible ways of clean energy and to be open to newer ways of
                approaching a problem and given the benefits that it offers,by
                safe understanding and maintenance nuclear energy could be one
                of the solutions.

                Lastly,Awareness leads to knowledge and knowledge leads to
                employment and thereby increase in investments. So investments
                in cleaner and greener technologies could lead to a better
                outcome.

                  This being one of the most important myths, is something that
                  must be given a lot of importance to. Ensuring that the world
                  is on the constant know -how about the happenings in the field
                  of nuclear energy. It is a subject ,that has various facets to
                  it and making sure that they are addressed the right way by
                  the associated organizations is a must. Considering this a
                  survey was taken up titled nuclear energy: a way forward? With
                  5 crucial questions that matter most. This has assisted us in
                  understanding a global perspective of nuclear energy
                  solutions. Initially it was considered that people in general
                  were too afraid to accept nuclear energy ,however,
                  surprisingly the results show otherwise.

                        Major releases of nuclear radioactive material

                        estimated that a total of 14 exabecquerel (EBq)2 (1 EBq
                        = 10^8 nuclear decays) of radioactive substances were
                        released. Because of their size, fuel particles and
                        larger particles (containing mostly strontium and
                        plutonium) were deposited less than 100 km away from the

                        About 36 hours after the accident, the Soviet
                        authorities started evacuating some 115,000 people who
                        lived nearby, though not before many had already begun
                        to suffer from vomiting and headaches. Believing they

                        On the night of April 25-26, 1986, Soviet technicians
                        initiated a turbine test on Unit 4 just prior to a
                        routine shut down for maintenance. In order to perform
                        the test, they unwisely disabled the emergency core
                        cooling system and other key safety equipment. A chain
                        of operating mistakes then ensued, resulting in a
                        build-up of steam that caused the reactor to overheat.
                        <br />
                        At 1:23 a.m., two to three rapid-fire explosions blew
                        its steel and concrete lid right off and sent a fireball
                        shooting high into the sky. This initial release of
                        radioactive material was then compounded by several
                        fires that broke out, including one inside the reactor
                        core that raged for 10 days. All told, the accident at
                        Chernobyl released at least 100 times more radiation
                        than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

                <h3>Chernobyl, 1986</h3>
                <p>
                  The accident at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine shocked the
                  world, permanently altered a region, and leaves many questions
                  unanswered pertaining to its extent of impact. An incident
                  that took place on April 25 and 26, 1986. It is what is now
                  northern Ukraine as a reactor at a nuclear power plant
                  exploded and burned. The disaster took place near the city of
                  Chernobyl in the former USSR, which invested heavily in
                  nuclear power after World War II.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Starting in 1977, Soviet scientists installed four RBMK
                  nuclear reactors at the power plant, which is located just
                  south of what is now Ukraine’s border with Belarus. Below is
                  an exciting quiz pertaining to a lot of detailed facts
                  regarding this catastrophic event. You can expect interesting
                  facts as well, perhaps something that you weren’t aware of.
